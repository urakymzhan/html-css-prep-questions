      <h4>Common Questions</h4>

      <h3>What does a doctype do?</h3>
      <p>
        doctype is an instruction to the browser to inform about the version
        of html document and how browser should render it.
      </p>

      <h3>What is Semantic HTML? Can you tell me HTML 5 elements?</h3>
      <p>
        Semantic HTML introduces meaning to the web page rather than just
        presentation for example <code>strong</code> instead of
        <code>b</code> <code>header, aside, nav</code> instead of
        <code>div</code>
      </p>

      <h3>Do all HTML tags have an end tag?</h3>
      <p>
        No. There are some HTML tags that don't need a closing tag. For
        example: <code>image</code> tag, <code> br </code> tag
      </p>

      <h3>What is the differences between div and span?</h3>
      <p>
        The difference is that <code>span</code> gives the output with
        <code>display:inline</code> and <code>div</code> gives the output with
        <code>display:block</code>. span is used when we need our elements to
        be shown in a line, one after the other.
      </p>

      <h3>What is the use of the required attribute in HTML5?</h3>
      <p>
        It forces a user to fill text on the text field or text area before
        submitting the form. It is used for form validation. Example:
        <code> &lt;input type="text" name="name" required&gt; </code>
      </p>

      <h3>
        Explain the three main ways to apply CSS styles to a web page. When
        would you prefer which one?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Inline CSS - You can apply CSS style inside the HTML tags(elements)
        that’s called inline CSS.<br />
        Internal Style Sheet - You can apply CSS styles Inside &lt;head&gt;
        section in HTML using <code>&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;</code>.<br />
        External Style Sheet - Create another file save it with .css extension
        and then link this css file using <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>.<br />
      </p>

      <h3>What is the difference between classes and ID’s in CSS?</h3>
      <p>
        Classes are reusable CSS reference selectors named
        <code>class=</code> in the HTML document and prefixed by a period in a
        stylesheet. ID’s are declared as <code>id=</code> in HTML and
        referenced by the # (hashtag.) ID’s are designed for unique
        specificity since they can only ever be used by JavaScript once.
        Though styles applied by ID through CSS do affect all instances of the
        ID.
      </p>

      <h3>Could you describe the different kinds of selectors?</h3>
      <p>
        We can divide CSS selectors into five categories: <br />
        <code>Simple selectors</code>(id, class, name etc.)<br />
        <code>Combinator selectors</code>(descendant selector(space), child
        selector(>), adjacent sibling selector (+), general sibling selector
        (~) .)<br />
        <code>Pseudo-class selectors</code>(visited, hover, link, active
        etc.)<br />
        <code>Pseudo-elements selectors</code> (first-line, first-letter
        etc.)<br />
        <code>Attribute selectors</code> (a[target] etc.)<br />
      </p>

      <h3>
        What is the CSS display property and can you give a few examples of
        its use?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The display property specifies the display behavior (the type of
        rendering box) of an element. <br />
        <code>display: none;</code><br />
        <code>display: inline;</code><br />
        <code>display: block;</code><br />
        <code>display: inline-block;</code> <br />

          here.</a>
      </p>

      <h3>What is CSS specificity?</h3>
      <p>
        Specificity is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property
        values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be
        applied. Check
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_display.asp" target="_blank">

      </p>

      <h3>How can u highlight text in html?</h3>
      <p>
        By using <i>&lt;mark&gt; </i> element. Ex: Hey I am
        <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> marked <code>&lt;/mark&gt;</code> text!
      </p>

      <h3>When should you use section, div or article?</h3>
      <p>
        <code>section</code>, group of content inside is related to a single
        theme, and should appear as an entry in an outline of the page. It’s a
        chunk of related content, like a subsection of a long article, a major
        part of the page (eg the news section on the homepage), or a page in a
        webapp’s tabbed interface. A section normally has a heading (title)
        and maybe a footer too.<br />

        <code>article</code>, represents a complete, or self-contained,
        composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is, in
        principle, independently distributable or reusable, e.g. in
        syndication. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper
        article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget
        or gadget, or any other independent item of content.<br />

        <code>div</code>, on the other hand, does not convey any meaning,
        aside from any found in its class, lang and title attributes.
      </p>

      <h3>What does float do?</h3>
      <p>
        <code>float</code> pushes an element to the sides of a page with text
        wrapped around it. you can create entire page or a smaller area by
        using float. if size of a floated element changes, text around it will
        re-flow to accommodate the changes. You can have float left, right,
        none or inherit.<br />
        if you set, <code>'float: left;'</code> for an image, it will move to
        the left until the margin, padding or border of another block-level
        element is reached. The normal flow will wrap around on the right
        side.
      </p>

      <h3>
        How can you fix, "floated points don't add up to the height of a
        parent"? Basically how do you clear floats?
      </h3>
      <p>
        You can use clear: both in an empty div
        <code> &lt;div style="clear: both;"&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code>, you can
        use overflow hidden or scroll and you can float the parent as well.

      <h3>How absolute, relative, fixed and static position differ?</h3>
      <p>
        <code>absolute</code>, place an element exactly where you want to
        place it. absolute position is actually set relative to the element's
        parent. if no parent available then relatively place to the page
        itself.<br />

        <code>relative</code>, is position an element relative to itself (from
        where the element would be placed, if u don't apply relative
        positioning). for example, if u set position relative to an element
        and set top: 10px, it will move 10px down from where it would be
        normally.<br />

        <code>fixed</code>, element is positioned relative to viewport or the
        browser window itself. viewport doesn't changed if u scroll and hence
        fixed element will stay right in the same position.<br />

        <code>static</code>, element will be positioned based on the normal
        flow of the document. usually, u will use position static to remove
        other position might be applied to an element.<br />

      <h3>
        What are the differences between visibility hidden and display none?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <code>display:</code> none removes the element from the normal layout
        flow and allow other elements to fill in. <br />
        <code>visibility:</code> hidden tag is rendered, it takes space in the
        normal flow but doesn't show it<br />

      <h3>
        What does <code>* { box-sizing: border-box; }</code> do? What are its
        advantages?
      </h3>
      <p>
        By default, elements have box-sizing: content-box applied, and only
        the content size is being accounted for.<br />
        <code>box-sizing:</code> border-box changes how the width and height
        of elements are being calculated, border and padding are also being
        included in the calculation.<br />
        The <code>height</code> of an element is now calculated by the
        content's height + vertical padding + vertical border width.<br />
        The <code>width</code> of an element is now calculated by the
        content's width + horizontal padding + horizontal border width. Taking
        into account paddings and borders as part of our box model resonates
        better with how designers actually imagine content in grids.<br />

      <h3>
        What are the differences between inline, block and inline-block?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <code>inline</code>, elements do not break the flow. think of span it
        fits in the line. Important points about inline elements, margin/
        padding will push other elements horizontally not vertically.
        Moreover, inline elements ignores height and width.<br />

        <code>block</code>, breaks the flow and dont sits inline. they are
        usually container like div, section, ul and also text p, h1, etc.<br />

        <code>inline-block</code>, will be similar to inline and will go with
        the flow of the page. Only differences is this this will take height
        and width.<br />

      <h3>What is Box Model? What are the properties related to it?</h3>
      <p>
        Technically, height, width, padding and border are part of box model
        and margin is related to it.<br />

        <i>Extra:</i> Everything in a web page is a box where you can control
        size, position, background, etc. Each box/ content area is optionally
        surrounded by padding, border and margin. When you set height and
        width of an element, you set content height and width.<br />

      <h3>How <code>overflow</code> attribute works in CSS ?</h3>
      <p>
        The CSS overflow property controls what happens to content that is too
        big to fit into an area.<br />

        Check
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_overflow_intro" target="_blank">

      </p>

      <h3>How do you align a p center-center inside a div?</h3>
      <p>
        <code>text-align: center</code> will do the horizontal alignment but
        <code>vertical-align: middle</code> will not work here. there are
        couple of different ways to solve this problem and one of them are
        positioning. You make the parent as relative position and child as
        absolute positioning. And then define all position parameter as sero
        and width 50% and height 30%.<br />

        Check
        <a href="http://vanseodesign.com/css/vertical-centering/" target="_blank">

        </a>
      </p>

      <h3>Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed?</h3>
      <p>
        The z-index property in CSS controls the vertical stacking order of
        elements that overlap. z-index only affects elements that have a
        position value which is not static.<br />

        Without any z-index value, elements stack in the order that they
        appear in the DOM (the lowest one down at the same hierarchy level
        appears on top). Elements with non-static positioning (and their
        children) will always appear on top of elements with default static
        positioning, regardless of HTML hierarchy.<br />

        A stacking context is an element that contains a set of layers. Within
        a local stacking context, the z-index values of its children are set
        relative to that element rather than to the document root. Layers
        outside of that context — i.e. sibling elements of a local stacking
        context — can't sit between layers within it. If an element B sits on
        top of element A, a child element of element A, element C, can never
        be higher than element B even if element C has a higher z-index than
        element B.<br />

        Each stacking context is self-contained - after the element's contents
        are stacked, the whole element is considered in the stacking order of
        the parent stacking context. A handful of CSS properties trigger a new
        stacking context, such as opacity less than 1, filter that is not
        none, and transform that is notnone.<br />

      <h3>Should you use !important?</h3>
      <p>
        When you’re wrestling with specificity, trying to override that one
        style, you may be tempted to add !important to your style. Think very
        carefully before you do so! It may seem harmless, but if you do this
        all over the place, you will soon find yourself in a big mess that you
        cannot get out of.<br />

        What !important does, is make that particular style have the highest
        specificity possible. Nothing else can override it, apart from another
        !important. You might be able to see where this is going, but once you
        start using them, you’ll almost certainly get into a position where
        you need to override a rule marked as !important, which forces you to
        use another one. And so the cycle continues.<br />
        <code>
            /* high specificity */<br />
            .large .navigation.navigation-large { <br />
            font-size: 2em;<br />
            }<br />

            /* will override the above, but it's dangerous! */<br />
            .navigation {<br />
            font-size: 3em !important;<br />
            }
          </code>
      </p>

      <h3>
        What is the difference between <code>px</code>, <code>em</code> and
        <code>rem</code> sizing fonts?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <code>TL;DR:</code>

        <code>Pixels</code> are ignorant, don’t use them. Use
        <code>REMs</code> for sizes and spacing. Use <code>EMs</code> for
        media queries.<br />

      <h3>
        What's the difference between the <code>nth-of-type()</code> and
        <code>nth-child()</code> selectors?
      </h3>

      <p>
        <code>TL;DR:</code><br />

        <code>:nth-child</code> selector, in “Plain English,” means select an
        element if:<br />

        It is a paragraph element<br />
        It is the second child of a parent<br />
        <code>:nth-of-type</code> selector, in “Plain English,” means:<br />

        Select the second paragraph child of a parent<br />

      <h3>Explain the term Responsive web design ?</h3>
      <p>
        It is a method in which we design and develop a web page according to
        the user activities and conditions which are based on various
        components like the size of the screen, portability of the web page on
        the different devices, etc. It is done by using different flexible
        layouts and grids.
      </p>

      <h3>How do we make a rounded corner by using CSS?</h3>
      <p>
        We can make a rounded corner by using the property
        <code>border-radius</code>. We can apply this property to any element.
      </p>

      <h3>What is CSS flexbox?</h3>
      <p>
        It allows you to design a flexible responsive layout structure without
        using any float or positioning property of CSS. To use CSS flexbox you
        need to define a flex container initially.
      </p>

      <h3>Write all the properties of the flexbox?</h3>
      <p>
        There are several properties of the flexbox that are used in the HTML
        webpage.<br />

        They are:<br />

        flex-direction<br />
        flex-wrap<br />
        flex-flow<br />
        justify-content<br />
        align-items<br />
        align-content<br />
      </p>

      <h3>How can we add icons to the web page?</h3>
      <p>
        We can add icons to the HTML webpage by using an icon library like
        font-awesome.<br />

        We have to add the name of the given icon class to any inline HTML
        element. ( &lt;i&gt; or &lt;span&gt;) . Icons in the icon libraries
        are scalable vectors that can be customized with CSS.
      </p>

      <h3>What are the differences between relative and absolute in CSS?</h3>
      <p>
        The main difference between relative and absolute is that “relative”
        is used for the same tag in CSS and it means that if we write the
        left:10px then the padding will shift to 10px in the left while
        absolute is totally relative to the non-static parent.<br />

        It means, if we write left:10px then the result will be 10px far from
        the left edge of the parent element.
      </p>

      <h3>Differentiate between inline and block element?</h3>
      <p>
        Inline element does not have an element to set width and height and
        also it does not have the line break. Ex:
        <code>em, strong</code> etc.<br />
        Block element specification:<br />

        They do have the line break.<br />
        They define the width by setting a container and also allow setting
        height.<br />
        It can also contain an element that occurs in the inline element.<br />
      </p>

      <h3>What are empty elements?</h3>
      <p>
        HTML elements with no content are called empty elements. For example:
        &lt;br&gt;, &lt;hr&gt; etc.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What are the different ways to visually hide content (and make it
        available only for screen readers)?
      </h3>
      <p>
        These techniques are related to accessibility (a11y). <br />
        - <code>width: 0; height: 0.</code> Make the element not take up any
        space on the screen at all, resulting in not showing it.<br />
        - <code>position: absolute; left: -99999px.</code> Position it outside
        of the screen.<br />
        - <code>text-indent: -9999px.</code> This only works on text within
        the block elements.<br />
        - Meta tags. For example by using Schema.org, RDF, and JSON-LD.<br />
        - WAI-ARIA. (HTML5 doesn't suggest this though Check
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA" target="_blanket">MDN docs</a>) A W3C
        technical specification that specifies how to increase the
        accessibility of web pages.<br />
        Even if WAI-ARIA is the ideal solution, I would go with the absolute
        positioning approach, as it has the least caveats, works for most
        elements and it's an easy technique.
      </p>

      <!-- ADVANCED Questions -->
      <h4>Advanced Questions</h4>
      <h3>
        What's the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which
        would you choose, and why?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <i>Resetting</i> - Resetting is meant to strip all default browser
        styling on elements. For e.g. margins, paddings, font-sizes of all
        elements are reset to be the same. You will have to redeclare styling
        for common typographic elements. <br />
        <i>Normalizing</i> - Normalizing preserves useful default styles
        rather than "unstyling" everything. It also corrects bugs for common
        browser dependencies.<br />
        I would choose resetting when I have a very customized or
        unconventional site design such that I need to do a lot of my own
        styling and do not need any default styling to be preserved.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What are the various clearing techniques and which is appropriate for
        what context?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Empty div method -
        <code>&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</code><br />
        Clearfix method - Refer to the <code>.clearfix</code> class above.
        <br />
        overflow: <code>auto or overflow: hidden</code> method - Parent will
        establish a new block formatting context and expand to contains its
        floated children.<br />
        In large projects, I would write a utility .clearfix class and use
        them in places where I need it. overflow: hidden might clip children
        if the children is taller than the parent and is not very ideal.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or
        site?
      </h3>
      <p>
        CSS sprites combine multiple images into one single larger image. It
        is a commonly-used technique for icons (Gmail uses it). How to
        implement it:<br />

        1. Use a sprite generator that packs multiple images into one and
        generate the appropriate CSS for it.<br />
        2. Each image would have a corresponding CSS class with
        background-image, background-position and background-size properties
        defined.<br />
        3. To use that image, add the corresponding class to your element.<br />

        Advantages: <br />

        - Reduce the number of HTTP requests for multiple images (only one
        single request is required per spritesheet). But with HTTP2, loading
        multiple images is no longer much of an issue.<br />
        - Advance downloading of assets that won't be downloaded until needed,
        such as images that only appear upon :hover pseudo-states. Blinking
        wouldn't be seen.<br />
      </p>

      <h3>
        How would you approach fixing browser-specific styling issues?
      </h3>
      <p>
        - After identifying the issue and the offending browser, use a
        separate style sheet that only loads when that specific browser is
        being used. - This technique requires server-side rendering though.<br />
        - Use libraries like Bootstrap that already handles these styling
        issues for you.<br />
        - Use autoprefixer to automatically add vendor prefixes to your
        code.<br />
        Use Reset CSS or Normalize.css.<br />
        - If you're using Postcss (or a similar transpiling library), there
        may be plugins which allow you to opt in for using modern CSS syntax
        (and even W3C proposals) that will transform those sections of your
        code into corresponding safe code that will work in the targets you've
        used.<br />
      </p>

      <h3>
        Have you ever used a grid system, and if so, what do you prefer?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Before Flex became popular (around 2014), the float-based grid system
        was the most reliable because it still has the most browser support
        among the alternative existing systems (flex, grid). Bootstrap was
        using the float approach until Bootstrap 4 which switched to the
        flex-based approach. As of writing (2020), flex is the recommended
        approach for building grid systems and has
        <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=flex" target="_blank">decent browser support.</a><br />
        For the adventurous, they can look into
        <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/" target="_blank">CSS Grid Layout.</a>, which
        uses the shiny new grid property; it is even better than flex
        for building grid layouts and will be the de facto way to do so in the
        future.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Can you give an example of an @media property other than screen?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Yes, there are four types of @media properties (including screen):
        <br />
        <code>all</code> - for all media type devices<br />
        <code>print</code> - for printers<br />
        <code>speech</code> - for screenreaders that "reads" the page out
        loud<br />
        <code>screen</code> - for computer screens, tablets, smart-phones
        etc.<br />
        Here is an example of print media type's usage:<br />
        <code>
            @media print { <br />body<br />
            { color: black; } <br />}
          </code>
      </p>

      <h3>
        What are the advantages/disadvantages of using CSS preprocessors?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <i>Advantages:</i><br />
        - CSS is made more maintainable.<br />
        - Easy to write nested selectors. <br />
        - Variables for consistent theming. Can share theme files across
        different projects.<br />
        - Mixins to generate repeated CSS.<br />
        - Sass features like loops, lists, and maps can make configuration
        easier and less verbose.<br />
        - Splitting your code into multiple files. CSS files can be split up
        too but doing so will require an HTTP request to download each CSS
        file.<br />
        <i>Disadvantages:</i><br />
        - Requires tools for preprocessing. Re-compilation time can be
        slow.<br />
        - Not writing currently and potentially usable CSS. For example, by
        using something like postcss-loader with webpack, you can write
        potentially future-compatible CSS, allowing you to use things like CSS
        variables instead of Sass variables. Thus, you're learning new skills
        that could pay off if/when they become standardized.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What existing CSS frameworks have you used locally, or in production?
        How would you change/improve them?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <code>Bootstrap</code> - Slow release cycle. Bootstrap 4 has been in
        alpha for almost 2 years. Add a spinner button component, as it is
        widely used.<br />
        <code>Semantic UI</code> - Source code structure makes theme
        customization extremely hard to understand. Its unconventional theming
        system is a pain to customize. Hardcoded config path within the vendor
        library. Not well-designed for overriding variables unlike in
        Bootstrap.<br />
        <code>Bulma</code>
        - A lot of non-semantic and superfluous classes and markup required.
        Not backward compatible. Upgrading versions breaks the app in subtle
        manners.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Can you explain the difference between coding a website to be
        responsive versus using a mobile-first strategy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Note that these two 2 approaches are not exclusive.<br />

        Making a website responsive means the some elements will respond by
        adapting its size or other functionality according to the device's
        screen size, typically the viewport width, through CSS media queries,
        for example, making the font size smaller on smaller devices.<br />

        <code>
            @media (min-width: 601px) {<br />
            .my-class {<br />
            font-size: 24px;<br />
            }<br />
            }<br />
          </code>
        <code>
            @media (max-width: 600px) {<br />
            .my-class {<br />
            font-size: 12px;<br />
            }<br />
            }<br />
          </code>

        A mobile-first strategy is also responsive, however it agrees we
        should default and define all the styles for mobile devices, and only
        add specific responsive rules to other devices later. Following the
        previous example:<br />

        <code>
            .my-class {<br />
            font-size: 12px;<br />
            }<br />
          </code>
        <code>
            @media (min-width: 600px) {<br />
            .my-class {<br />
            font-size: 24px;<br />
            }<br />
            }<br />
          </code>

        A mobile-first strategy has 2 main advantages:<br />

        It's more performant on mobile devices, since all the rules applied
        for them don't have to be validated against any media queries.<br />
        It forces to write cleaner code in respect to responsive CSS rules.<br />
      </p>

      <h3>
        Is there any reason you'd want to use translate() instead of absolute
        positioning, or vice-versa? And why?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <code>translate()</code> is a value of CSS transform. Changing
        transform or opacity does not trigger browser reflow or repaint but
        does trigger compositions; whereas changing the absolute positioning
        triggers reflow. transform causes the browser to create a GPU layer
        for the element but changing absolute positioning properties uses the
        CPU. Hence translate() is more efficient and will result in shorter
        paint times for smoother animations.<br />
        When using <code>translate()</code>, the element still occupies its
        original space (sort of like position: relative), unlike in changing
        the absolute positioning. Read more

      <h3>
        What UI, Security, Performance, SEO, Maintainability or Technology
        considerations do you make while building a web application or site?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <i>UI:</i> Depending on your audience, accessibility can be your
        biggest challenge and resources such as http://a11yproject.com are
        great in suggesting patterns to achieve whats needed. Beyond that, a
        pleasant palette and intuitive interfaces are the foundation, which
        arise from well developed style guides containing code snippets that
        help developers quickly deliver features with pre-themed UI elements
        that alleviate common pain points such as non-conforming elements that
        may distract stake holders during the iteration and approval
        process.<br />
        <i>Security:</i>
        - Login pages should be encrypted<br />
        - Data validation should be done server-side<br />
        - Manage your Web site via encrypted connections<br />
        <i>Performance:</i> Concatenation and minification of JS and CSS
        files, delivering SVG images wherever possible, icon fonts, use
        sprites as necessary and compressing images.<br />
        <i>SEO:</i> When it comes to SEO, I refer to my approach as “the new
        old school.” That is, I don’t believe there is any “magic in your
        meta” tags and I encourage business owners to simply create content
        that is relevant to your business, write clearly and often, advertise
        when necessary, make sure your site is mobile friendly, that sharing
        your content is easy, and you have control of your Google, Twitter,
        Facebook, Yahoo, Bing, Foursquare, Pinterest, Instagram (insert hot
        new here…) accounts, and everything really does fall into place. As
        your business grows, more visitors come, more people share and the
        search engines notice.<br />
        <i>Maintainability and Technology Considerations:</i> Use tooling that
        is more flexible and adhere’s to a standard. A great example of this
        is PostCSS, where the concept is, you write plain old CSS – and NEW
        CSS as well, including syntax not yet implemented in browsers and let
        a plugin process your css and manipulate the output so it’s browser
        ready. Then as time passes, W3C syntax is agreed upon, pre-fix use
        subsides, and you can re-process your CSS with less and less
        manipulation.
      </p>

      <h3>
        How would you optimize a website’s assets/resources?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Concatenate and compress CSS, JavaScript and HTML files wherever
        possible, configure your server to deliver a Gzip files, cache
        resources, set longer expirations dates on http headers of resources
        you don’t expect to change often – such as a logo. Images can be some
        of the heaviest files we deliver, so compress wisely. Soon the
        <code>picture</code> element will be implemented across browsers, so
        we can optimize the delivery of image content. Also in the near future
        consider using <code>WebP</code> format for images – it is quite
        smaller in size than JPEG and PNG files. Finally, use a CDN or other
        domains to host your resources and leverage domain sharding.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Explain what ARIA and screen readers are, and how to make a website
        accessible.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Screen readers are software programs that provide assistive
        technologies that allow people with disabilities (such as no sight,
        sound or mouse-ing ability) to use web applications. You can make your
        sites more accessible by following ARIA standards such as semantic
        HTML, alt attributes and using <code>[role=button]</code> in the
        expected ways.<br />

      <h3>
        Explain some of the pros and cons for CSS animations versus JavaScript
        animations.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Regarding optimization and responsiveness the debate bounces back and
        forth but, the concept is:<br />
        - CSS animations allows the browser to choose where the animation
        processing is done, CPU or the GPU. (Central or Graphics Processing
        Unit)<br />
        - That said, adding many layers to a document will eventually have a
        performance hit.<br />
        - JS animation means more code for the user to download and for the
        developer to maintain.<br />
        - Applying multiple animation types on an element is harder with CSS
        since all transforming power is in one property transform<br />
        - CSS animations being declarative are not programmable therefore
        limited in capability.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What does CORS stand for and what issue does it address?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Cross Origin Resource Sharing. To address the fact that browsers
        restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from within scripts.
        CORS gives web servers cross-domain access controls, which enable
        secure cross-domain data transfers.

      <h3>
        Describe the difference between a: <code>cookie</code>
        <code>sessionStorage</code> <code>localStorage</code>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <i>cookie</i>: A text file saved on the users computer to store and
        retrieve data<br />
        <i>sessionStorage:</i> Is memory space in a browser to save temporary
        data until the window or tab is closed.<br />
        <i>localStorage:</i> Like cookie, where data can be saved and
        retrieved after browser sessions, but stored in memory like
        sessionStorage. Data is stored as plain key value pairs and can be
        stored as Json objects. Check example

      <h3>
        Describe the difference between: <code>script</code>,
        <code>script async</code>, <code>script defer</code>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <i>Normal Execution: script:</i><br />
        Parsing of the HTML code pauses while the script is executing. For
        slow servers and heavy scripts this means that displaying the webpage
        will be delayed.<br />
        <i>Deferred Execution: script defer</i><br />
        Delays script execution until the HTML parser has finished. A positive
        effect of this attribute is that the DOM will be available for your
        script. However, since not every browser supports defer yet, can’t
        rely on it.<br />

        <i>Asynchronous Execution: script async</i><br />
        HTML parsing may continue and the script will be executed as soon as
        it’s ready.<br />
      </p>

      <h3>
        Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS ‘link’ references
        between ‘head’ and JS ‘script’ just before closing body? Do you know
        any exceptions?
      </h3>
      <p>
        CSS goes in the head to calculate the styles and layout before DOM
        elements load to prevent flashes of un-styled content. Loading JS just
        before the body close means the DOM will be available for it.<br />
        However, modern browsers have implemented ‘speculative parsing’ –
        where the browser ‘looks ahead’ in the HTML and begins downloading
        resources before scripts download and execute. (<a

        with it’s own flavor. Most recently I worked at Aspect Software, a
        Microsoft shop, where I embraced IIS, Visual Studio, Team Foundation
        Server, Office 365, One Drive, Share Point and more. As an aside, upon
        employment I was issued a Windows Phone and found the interface very
        exciting despite the lack of applications built for it.

        If you have 5 different stylesheets, how would you best integrate them
        into the site?
      </h3>
      <p>
        1. Break them up onto to different CDN servers to leverage domain
        sharding.<br />
        2. Employ the “new old” technique of adding “above the fold” css
        inline in the head of your document – reducing http requests and
        improve perceived performance.<br />
        3. Using SASS I would break up my files into related chunks – all of
        which are concatenated and compressed using compass, sass with gulp or
        grunt in your build process.<br />

        Get used to it and adjust. Adjusting and adapting are some of my
        greatest strengths.
      </p>

      <h3>When did you start experimenting with CSS?</h3>
      <p>
        The answer to this question gives you an idea of how much experience
        the job applicant has working with CSS. It can also tell you whether
        the person picked up the skill as a hobby or learned it in an academic
        or professional environment.<br />

        What to look for in an answer:<br />

        - Amount of experience with CSS<br />
        - Interest in building websites<br />
        - Excitement about new technology<br />
        Example: “I started using style sheets in high school. A few friends
        and I had been building a website about our favorite television shows.
        Eventually, the pages became a mess because they didn’t share a common
        aesthetic. The fonts and colors were different on every page. I
        learned how to use CSS so I could bring the pages into harmony without
        writing new HTML tags for each page.”
      </p>

      <h3>What is your favorite CSS feature?</h3>
      <p>
        It probably doesn’t matter what CSS feature your job applicant likes
        most. Finding out whether the person can speak freely about style
        sheets, however, shows that your applicant has a strong knowledge of
        CSS.<br />

        What to look for in an answer:<br />

        - Experience with CSS<br />
        - Understanding of CSS<br />
        - How to use CSS to save time<br />
        Example: “I started using style sheets in high school. A few friends
        and I had been building a website about our favorite television shows.
        Eventually, the pages became a mess because they didn’t share a common
        aesthetic. The fonts and colors were different on every page. I
        learned how to use CSS so I could bring the pages into harmony without
        writing new HTML tags for each page.”
      </p>

      <h3>
        Do you use CSS in combination with other markup or programming
        languages?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Web developers often rely on a few languages to build dynamic sites.
        The answer to this question shows that the applicant knows about other
        languages used to build sites. By prompting the person to name the
        languages, you make sure that the applicant has a deep understanding
        of the subject.<br />

        What to look for in an answer:<br />

        - Interest in front-end design<br />
        - Other language skills<br />
        - Creative problem solving<br />
        Example: “I started using style sheets in high school. A few friends
        and I had been building a website about our favorite television shows.
        Eventually, the pages became a mess because they didn’t share a common
        aesthetic. The fonts and colors were different on every page. I
        learned how to use CSS so I could bring the pages into harmony without
        writing new HTML tags for each page.”
      </p>

      <h3>
        Can you tell me about a project that forced you to learn something new
        about CSS?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Asking this question encourages people to reflect on their experiences
        with CSS. The answer may reveal several things, such as how much
        experience applicants have with CSS and how they use critical thinking
        to solve difficult problems.<br />

        What to look for in an answer:<br />

        - Understanding of CSS<br />
        - Amount of experience with CSS<br />
        - Critical thinking<br />
        Example: “I took a multidisciplinary class in college that created
        groups of librarians and engineers to work on unique projects. My
        group decided to digitize a large collection of handwritten poems in
        the library’s permanent collection. Making a style sheet that could
        accommodate the different sizes, shapes and qualities of the poems
        took a lot of effort.”
      </p>

      <h3>What’s your favorite project that required CSS?</h3>
      <p>
        This question gives you some insight into what the interviewee enjoys.
        The answer says more about the applicant’s personality than
        programming skills.<br />

        What to look for in an answer:<br />

        - Understanding of CSS's benefits<br />
        - Creative problem solving<br />
        - How applicant responds to challenges<br />
        Example: “I helped a friend build an online magazine that published
        articles, photographs, music and all kinds of media. It wasn’t a hard
        project. In fact, it was pretty easy. I just loved watching how happy
        my simple CSS changes made him. Over a few hours, his website went
        from OK to excellent. It reminded me of why it’s important to know
        CSS, JavaScript and other common languages in today’s world. You can’t
        do anything without building a good website to show it off.”
      </p>

      <h3>
        Do you have a resource that you use when you can’t remember a CSS
        function?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Programmers can’t keep everything in their heads, so they rely on
        references when they remember specific functions and terms. The answer
        to this question shows that the applicant knows about reliable CSS
        resources that may come in handy when working on future projects.<br />

        What to look for in an answer:<br />

        - Deep understanding of CSS resources<br />
        - Where to find CSS functions<br />
        - Insider knowledge of CSS<br />
        Example: “I helped a friend build an online magazine that published
        articles, photographs, music and all kinds of media. It wasn’t a hard
        project. In fact, it was pretty easy. I just loved watching how happy
        my simple CSS changes made him. Over a few hours, his website went

        do anything without building a good website to show it off.”
      </p>

      <h3>What is your least favorite part of working with CSS?</h3>
      <p>
        All people have things that they don’t like about their jobs. An
        honest answer to this question can help you place an applicant with
        the right team. For instance, if a person loves finding errors in CSS
        files, you may want to hire that applicant to work on a project with
        creative people who prefer focusing on the big picture.<br />

        What to look for in an answer:<br />

        - Understanding the pros and cons of CSS<br />
        - Knowing what role the applicant could play<br />
        - Learning about the applicant's other interests<br />
        Example: “CSS makes Web design a lot easier, but it still feels a
        little tedious. Ideally, I’d like to work with a dynamic language that
        lets users interact with websites. For the time being, though, I’m
        happy to hone my CSS skills and learn from more experienced people.”
      </p>

      <h3>What are some limitations of CSS? Do you know any?</h3>
      <p>
        There are several limitations of CSS such as:<br />

        - CSS can’t fulfill turning completeness hence, it can never perform
        logical like ‘if/else’, for/while, etc, or arithmetical tasks<br />
        - One cannot read files using CSS<br />
        - It cannot provide total control over document display and allows the
        contents of the page to come through whatever the browser is used.<br />
        - Ascending by selectors is not possible<br />
        - Limitations of vertical control<br />
        - No expressions as it is a text-based coding language<br />
        - No column declaration<br />
        - Pseudo-class not controlled by dynamic behavior<br />
        - Rules, styles, targeting specific text not possible<br />
      </p>

      <h3>
        What are the different versions of CSS? Which one you use right now?
